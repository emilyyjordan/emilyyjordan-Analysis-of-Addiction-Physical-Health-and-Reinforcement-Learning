Addiction can manifest from a variety of sources such as substance abuse, smoking, gambling, and obesity. The effects of addiction can permanently affect one’s decision-making and learning abilities even after prolonged abstinence. This is because addictive behavior affects the balance of the mesolimbic pathway responsible for dopamine levels in the basal ganglia of the brain which ultimately changes an individual’s internal reward/punishment reactions to stimuli.
