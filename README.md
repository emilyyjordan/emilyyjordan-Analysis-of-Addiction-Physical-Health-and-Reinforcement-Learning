# Analysis of Addiction, Physical Health, and Reinforcement Learning

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a driving question to use as the basis for a systematic literature review on the asymmetries between learning from gains and losses during value-based decision-making, specifically through the differences in dopamine receptor densities in the D2 (DRD2) and D1 pathways. With specific emphasis on the learning aspects of dopamine influence in the receptor region, understanding how changing parameters affect performance in decision-making in populations affected by addictions involving drug abuse, alcohol abuse, smoking, gambling, and obesity/binge-eating can directs a path to development of more effective therapeutic interventions and diagnostics in populations affected by addiction.
